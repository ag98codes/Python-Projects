This repository contains a collection of Python projects that I have worked on. Each project is carefully organized into sub-folders based on its topic, making it easy to navigate and find what you need.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of these projects, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. If you donâ€™t already have it, you can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, simply download the project files and run the main Python file in your preferred IDE or on the command line. For your convenience, I have also included Jupyter Notebook files that provide a more visually appealing and interactive way to explore the contents of each project.
